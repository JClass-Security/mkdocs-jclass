#### Description

**Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI.**

All people you employ should have appropriate screening before they can get to CUI. Screening might incorporate exercises, for example, record verifications and medication testing. 


## 9.2 PS.L2-3.9.2

**Ensure that organizational systems containing CUI are protected during and after personnel actions such as terminations and transfers.**

This prerequisite applies to reassignments or moves of people when the work force activity is long-lasting or of such stretched out spans as to require insurance.
