## 5.1 IA.L2-3.5.3

#### Description

**Use multifactor authentication (MFA) for local and network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts.**

## 5.2 IA.L2-3.5.4

#### Description

**Employ replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged and non-privileged accounts.**

Authentication processes oppose replay assaults on the off chance that it is unreasonable to effectively confirm by recording or replaying past validation messages. Replay-safe procedures incorporate conventions that utilization nonce or difficulties, for example, time coordinated or challenge-reaction one-time authenticators


## 5.3 IA.L2-3.5.5

#### Description

**Prevent reuse of identifiers for a defined period.**

Preventing reuse of identifiers suggests forestalling the task of recently utilized individual, gathering, job, or gadget identifiers to various people, gatherings, jobs, or gadgets. Identifiers extraordinarily partner a client ID to an individual, gathering, job, or gadget.


## 5.4 IA.L2-3.5.6

#### Description

**Disable identifiers after a defined period of inactivity.**

You might consider a multi-step survey in which the record is impaired following 30 days, and afterward erased following 90 days. Also, recognize accounts which have never signed on. These ought to be debilitated in a lot more limited time period, like seven days or less.

## 5.5 IA.L2-3.5.7

#### Description

**Enforce a minimum password complexity and change of characters when new passwords are created.**

This prerequisite applies to single-factor authentication of people involving passwords as individual or gathering authenticators, and likewise, when passwords are utilized as a component of multifaceted authenticators.

## 5.6 IA.L2-3.5.8

#### Description

**Prohibit password reuse for a specified number of generations.**

Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords. People may not reuse their passwords for a characterized timeframe and a set number of passwords created.

## 5.7 IA.L2-3.5.9

#### Description

**Allow temporary password use for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.**

Changing impermanent passwords to extremely durable passwords following framework logon guarantees that the important strength of the confirmation instrument is executed at the earliest open door, lessening the weakness to authenticator splits the difference.

## 5.8 IA.L2-3.5.10

#### Description

**Store and transmit only cryptographically- protected passwords.**

Cryptographically-safeguarded passwords utilize salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. See NIST Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines. All passwords should be cryptographically safeguarded involving a one-way capability for capacity and transmission.

## 5.9 IA.L2-3.5.11

#### Description

**Obscure feedback of authentication information.**

Authentication information incorporates passwords. At the point when users enter a secret phrase, the framework shows an image, like an indicator, to cloud criticism keeping others from seeing the genuine characters. Input is clouded in light of a characterized strategy (e.g., more modest gadgets may momentarily show characters prior to darkening).
