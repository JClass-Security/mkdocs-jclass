## There are three levels of CMMC being followed:

### Level 1 - Foundational 
This level will apply to most companies in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and requires compliance with 17 basic cyber hygiene practices. Companies at this level can provide an annual self-attestation regarding their compliance.
### Level 2 - Advanced
This level applies to companies that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). At this level, companies must comply with the requires of NIST SP 800-171, which is already required of most companies handling CUI. Some companies at this level will be required to pursue a third-party certification of their security program based on whether they are engaged in what the DoD labels a “prioritized acquisition.”
### Level 3 - Expert
Details have not yet been released for this level, which will apply to companies handling the most sensitive information from the DoD
