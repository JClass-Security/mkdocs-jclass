# CMMC Level 2

### Visit [ jclass.solutions](http://www.jclass.solutions/)

We previously reported on Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level 1 as the foundation for a sound security Stance. Level 2 can most accurately be described as a bridge to level 3. 

## What is CMMC Level 2 and its Comparison with Level 1?
CMMC level 2 is an incremental yet important milestone for defense contractors to address. While CMMC Level 1 provides a solid foundation for basic cybersecurity applications, Level 2 focuses on implementing intermediate cyber hygiene practices. In addition to safeguarding Federal Contract Information (FCI), level 2 begins to include protections of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Compared to level 1, the additional sets of practices included in level 2 position the organization to better defend against more dangerous cyber threats.

Level 2 also requires to document the practices used to implement each domain. This documented practice demonstrates repeatability when the activities are performed to ensure consistent results.

## The CMMC Level 2 is grouped in 14 domains:

### Domain AC

Access Control requirements for level 2 include various ways to limit access. Some examples include employing the principle of least privilege and carefully monitoring remote access sessions.
Domain AT: Awareness and Training requires organizations to conduct cybersecurity training for managers, administrators and users who access organization systems.

###  Domain AU
Audit and Accountability covers the need to log system users’ activity and review these logs for monitoring purposes.
Domain CM: Configuration Management calls for creating configuration settings for all organizational systems, including equipment, software and documents, and to enforce these settings. If you need to make changes to configurations, you must first consider the security implications.

### Domain IA
Identification and Authentication is focused on limiting access in a similar way as Domain AC. Domain IA is more focused on ensuring no one is able to pass for an authorized user if they are not one. This means strategic password practices, for example, are critical.
### Domain IR
Incident Response requires your organization to have a plan in place to handle security incidents that could occur in the future and to handle these incidents carefully.
### Domain MA
Maintenance controls outline the requirements for protecting critical data and services in the event of a computer system failure.
### Domain MP
Media Protection is aimed at preventing security problems as a result of the use of removable media, such as flash drives. For instance, you must sanitize or destroy any media that includes Federal Contract Information before you release, reuse or dispose of it.
### Domain PE
Personal Security governs the screening of all individuals who are to have access to systems containing CUI and other sensitive data. This domain also encompasses the protection of systems and user accounts during staff transfers and terminations.
### Domain PS
Physical Protection says you must consider the physical security of your facility and your data. Practices like escorting visitors and screening personnel can help prevent security breaches.
### Domain RM
Risk Management, as the name suggests, is targeted at managing security risks. This means conducting periodic risk assessments and fixing any vulnerabilities you uncover.
### Domain CA
Security Assessment requires a defense contractor organization to periodically assess their cybersecurity plans and practices to make sure they’re working effectively. If there are problems, they should create new action plans to address the deficiencies.
### Domain SC
Systems and Communications Protection involves the way information should be transmitted or received by your informational systems. Your organization should monitor and control this communication.
### Domain SC
Systems and Information Integrity covers the detection of potentially suspicious system commands and the regular monitoring and documentation of suspicious behavior.
