Level 2 can most accurately be described as a bridge to level 3. What is CMMC Level 2 and its Comparison with Level 1? \u00b6 CMMC level 2 is an incremental yet important milestone for defense contractors to address. While CMMC Level 1 provides a solid foundation for basic cybersecurity applications, Level 2 focuses on implementing intermediate cyber hygiene practices. In addition to safeguarding Federal Contract Information (FCI), level 2 begins to include protections of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Compared to level 1, the additional sets of practices included in level 2 position the organization to better defend against more dangerous cyber threats. Level 2 also requires to document the practices used to implement each domain. This documented practice demonstrates repeatability when the activities are performed to ensure consistent results. The CMMC Level 2 is grouped in 14 domains: \u00b6 Domain AC \u00b6 Access Control requirements for level 2 include various ways to limit access. Some examples include employing the principle of least privilege and carefully monitoring remote access sessions. Domain AT: Awareness and Training requires organizations to conduct cybersecurity training for managers, administrators and users who access organization systems. Domain AU \u00b6 Audit and Accountability covers the need to log system users\u2019 activity and review these logs for monitoring purposes. Domain CM: Configuration Management calls for creating configuration settings for all organizational systems, including equipment, software and documents, and to enforce these settings. If you need to make changes to configurations, you must first consider the security implications. Domain IA \u00b6 Identification and Authentication is focused on limiting access in a similar way as Domain AC. Domain IA is more focused on ensuring no one is able to pass for an authorized user if they are not one. This means strategic password practices, for example, are critical. Domain IR \u00b6 Incident Response requires your organization to have a plan in place to handle security incidents that could occur in the future and to handle these incidents carefully. Domain MA \u00b6 Maintenance controls outline the requirements for protecting critical data and services in the event of a computer system failure. Domain MP \u00b6 Media Protection is aimed at preventing security problems as a result of the use of removable media, such as flash drives. For instance, you must sanitize or destroy any media that includes Federal Contract Information before you release, reuse or dispose of it. Domain PE \u00b6 Personal Security governs the screening of all individuals who are to have access to systems containing CUI and other sensitive data. This domain also encompasses the protection of systems and user accounts during staff transfers and terminations. Domain PS \u00b6 Physical Protection says you must consider the physical security of your facility and your data. Practices like escorting visitors and screening personnel can help prevent security breaches. Domain RM \u00b6 Risk Management, as the name suggests, is targeted at managing security risks. This means conducting periodic risk assessments and fixing any vulnerabilities you uncover. Domain CA \u00b6 Security Assessment requires a defense contractor organization to periodically assess their cybersecurity plans and practices to make sure they\u2019re working effectively. If there are problems, they should create new action plans to address the deficiencies. Domain SC \u00b6 Systems and Communications Protection involves the way information should be transmitted or received by your informational systems. Your organization should monitor and control this communication.

In particular, it safeguards the Defense Industrial Base sector (DIB) and the broader supply chain of DoD contractors from cybercrime targeting sensitive information. The second version of CMMC came out in November 2021 and it\u2019s affecting all DoD contractors and their supply chains working with federal contract information (FCI) or controlled unclassified information (CUI). The CMMC Framework \u00b6 Protecting Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that reside on supplier networks is an important step in reducing risk to National Security. The Department of Defense created the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) to raise the level of information security across the entire Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and better protect our nation's critical information. In contrast to traditional CMMC that is composed of 5 levels, now CMMC model 2.0 is being followed that is better yet it simplifies compliance. The Certification levels will be determined through audits from independent, third-party assessment organizations (C3PAO). J-Class\u2019s Portfolio of CMMC \u00b6 J-Class adopted the CMMC model 2.0, comprising 3 levels and each level entails different practices. In this document, we will go through all the levels and have a look at the features implemented at each level and what they offer. ACCESS CONTROL (AC) \u00b6 The access control (AC) domain focuses on the tracking and understanding of who has access to your systems and network.
