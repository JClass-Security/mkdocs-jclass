## 1.1 AC.L2-3.1.3

#### Description

Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations. Control the progression of CUI as per supported approvals. Conversation: Information stream control directs where data can go inside a framework and between frameworks (versus who can get to the data) and without unequivocal respect to ensuing.

## 1.2 AC.L2-3.1.4 

#### Description

Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.

## 1.3 AC.L2-3.1.5

####  Description:

Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.
Associations utilize the rule of least honor for explicit obligations and approval gets to for clients and cycles. The guideline of least honor is applied with the objective of approved honors no higher than needed to achieve required authoritative missions or business capabilities.

## 1.4 AC.L2-3.1.6 

#### Description

Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing nonsecurity functions.
Utilize non-special records or jobs while getting to non security capabilities. The object of this control is to set up an administrator account and a non-administrator to represent restricted admittance and no-restricted admittance.

## 1.5 AC.L2-3.1.7 

#### Description

Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of such functions in audit logs. 
Privileged functions incorporate laying out framework accounts, performing system honesty checks, directing fixing tasks, or overseeing cryptographic key administration exercises. Non-Privileged clients are people that don't have suitable approvals. 

## 1.6 AC.L2-3.1.8

#### Description

Limit unsuccessful login attempts.
ontinuous unsuccessful logon attempt might show malicious activity. Contractor can alleviate these attacks by restricting the quantity of unsuccessful logon attempt, commonly by locking the record.

## 1.7 AC.L2-3.1.9 

#### Description

Provide privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules. 
Every System containing or giving admittance to CUI has legitimate prerequisites concerning client protection and security. One strategy for tending to this prerequisite is the utilization of a framework use notice standard that shows the lawful necessities of using the system.

## 1.8 AC.L2-3.1.10 

#### Description

Use session lock with pattern-hiding displays to prevent access and viewing of data after a period of inactivity. 
You can control when a screen saver will pop up with the Global Policies Object in windows. You will need to use GPO's later so start getting used to setting up GPO's for specific controls.

## 1.9 AC.L2-3.1.11

#### Description

Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition.:
This necessity addresses the end of client-started coherent meetings rather than the termination of network associations that are related with correspondence meetings (i.e., disengaging from the network).

## 1.10 AC.L2-3.1.12 

#### Description

Monitor and control remote access sessions:
Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber- attacks and help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones.

## 1.11 AC.L2-3.1.13

#### Description

Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.
A remote access session involves logging into the organizationâ€™s systems such as its internal network or a cloud service provider from a remote location such as home or an alternate work site.

## 1.12 AC.L2-3.1.14 

# ###Description

Route remote access via managed access control points.
Routing remote access through supervised admittance control focuses upgrades unequivocal, hierarchical command over such associations, lessening the weakness to unapproved admittance to authoritative frameworks bringing about the unapproved exposure of CUI.

## 1.13 AC.L2-3.1.15 

#### Description

Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security- relevant information.
A privileged command is a human-started (intuitively or by means of a cycle working for the benefit of the human) order executed on a System including the control, monitoring, or administration of the system including security works and related security-pertinent information.

## 1.14 AC.L2-3.1.16 

#### Description

Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections.
Establishing out utilization limitations and configuration/connection prerequisites for wireless access to the system gives rules to associations to help remote access approval choices.

## 1.15 AC.L2-3.1.17 

#### Description

Protect wireless access using authentication and encryption. 

Utilize a blend of validation and encryption strategies to safeguard the admittance to remote organizations. Verifying clients to a remote passage can be accomplished in more ways than one. The most widely recognized verification and encryption techniques utilized include:

## 1.16 AC.L2-3.1.18

#### Description 

Control connection of mobile devices. 
A cell phone is a processing gadget that has a little structure variable to such an extent that it can undoubtedly be conveyed by a solitary individual; is intended to work without an actual association (e.g., remotely communicate or get data)

## 1.17 AC.L2-3.1.19 

#### Description

Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms 
Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices and computing platforms. 

## 1.18 AC.L2-3.1.21 

#### Description

Limit use of portable storage devices on external systems. 
Limits on the utilization of association controlled compact capacity gadgets in outside frameworks incorporate total disallowance of the utilization of such gadgets or limitations on how the gadgets might be utilized and under what conditions the gadgets might be utilized.
