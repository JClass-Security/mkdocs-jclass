## 13.1 SC.L2-3.13.2

#### Description

**Employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational systems.**

Organizations apply systems security designing standards to new improvement frameworks or systems going through significant overhauls. For heritage systems , associations apply systems security designing standards to systems redesigns and adjustments to the degree attainable, given the present status of equipment, programming, and firmware parts inside those systems.

## 13.2 SC.L2-3.13.3

#### Description

**Separate user functionality from system management functionality.**

System management functionality includes functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or logical.

## 13.3 SC.L2-3.13.4

#### Description

**Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.**

The control of data in shared system assets (e.g., registers, store memory, fundamental memory, hard plates) is likewise regularly alluded to as protest reuse and leftover data security.

## 13.4 SC.L2-3.13.6

#### Description

**Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).**

Block all traffic entering and leaving the organization, however, grant explicit traffic in view of hierarchical approaches, special cases, or standards. This course of allowing just approved traffic to the organization is called whitelisting and limits the number of inadvertent associations with the network.

## 13.5 SC.L2-3.13.7

#### Description

**Prevent remote devices from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with organizational systems and communicating via some other connection to resources in external networks (i.e., split tunneling).**

Keep distant devices from all the while laying out non-far off associations with hierarchical frameworks and imparting through another association with assets in outer organizations (i.e., split burrowing).

## 13.6 SC.L2-3.13.8

#### Description

**Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.**

The expectation of this training is to guarantee CUI is cryptographically safeguarded during travel, especially on the web. The most well-known method for achieving this is to lay out a TLS burrow between the source and objective utilizing the latest rendition of TLS

## 13.7 SC.L2-3.13.9

#### Description

**Terminate network connections associated with communications sessions at the end of the sessions or after a defined period of inactivity.**

Prevent malicious  entertainers from exploiting an open organization meeting or an unattended PC toward the finish of the association. Balance client work examples and requirements against security to decide the length of inertia that will drive an end.

## 13.8 SC.L2-3.13.10

#### Description

**Establish and manage cryptographic keys for cryptography employed in organizational systems.**

Cryptographic key administration and foundation can be performed utilizing manual methodology or instruments upheld by manual strategies. Associations characterize key administration prerequisites as per material government regulations, Executive Orders, arrangements, mandates, guidelines, and principles indicating proper choices, levels, and boundaries.

## 13.9 SC.L2-3.13.11

#### Description

**Employ FIPS-validated cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI.**

FIPS-approved cryptography is utilized while safeguarding the secrecy of CUI. BitLocker is FIPS-approved, however it requires a setting before encryption that guarantees that the encryption fulfills the guidelines set out by FIPS

## 13.10 SC.L2-3.13.12

#### Description

**Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and provide indication of devices in use to users present at the device.**

Collaborative computing devices incorporate networked white sheets, cameras, and mouthpieces. Sign of purpose incorporates signs to clients while Collaborative computing devices are actuated. Devoted video conferencing systems, which depend on one of the members calling or associating with the other party to initiate the video gathering, is prohibited.

## 13.11 SC.L2-3.13.13

#### Description

**Control and monitor the use of mobile code.**

How would you Control and Monitor Mobile Code? Portable code can be constrained by conveying extra security settings to internet browser applications, for example, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge programs. It can likewise be constrained by conveying extra security settings to Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft office items.


## 13.12 SC.L2-3.13.14

#### Description

**Control and monitor the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.**

Controlling VoIP advancements begins with laying out rules and implementing the proper use that is depicted in authoritative strategies. Checking ought to incorporate the clients' movement for something besides what is allowed and approved and location of unreliable or unapproved utilization of the VoIP innovation

## 13.13 SC.L2-3.13.15

#### Description

**Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.**
Authenticity protection includes protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into communications.

## 13.14 SC.L2-3.13.16

#### Description

**Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest.**

Implement the necessary security controls to protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest. Although an approved encryption method protects data stored at rest, there are other technical and physical solutions. The methods chosen should depend on the environment and business needs.
