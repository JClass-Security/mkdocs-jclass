## 8.1 MP.L2-3.8.1

#### Description

**Protect (i.e., physically control and securely store) system media containing CUI, both paper and digital.**

Access to CUI on framework media can be restricted by actually controlling such media, which incorporates directing inventories, guaranteeing techniques are set up to permit people to look at and return media to the media library, and keeping up with responsibility for all put away media.

## 8.2  MP.L2-3.8.2

#### Description

**Limit access to CUI on system media to authorized users.**

Limit actual admittance to CUI to individuals allowed to get to CUI. Utilize locked or controlled capacity regions and limit admittance to simply those permitted to get to CUI. Monitor who gets to actual CUI in a review log.

## 8.3 MP.L2-3.8.4

#### Description

**Mark media with necessary CUI markings and distribution limitations.**

The term security checking alludes to the application or utilization of comprehensible security credits. System media incorporates computerized and non-advanced media.

## 8.4 MP.L2-3.8.5

#### Description

**Control access to media containing CUI and maintain accountability for media during transport outside of controlled areas.**

CUI is safeguarded in both physical and advanced designs. Actual control can be achieved utilizing customary ideas like limited admittance to actual areas or securing papers in a work area or file organizer.

## 8.5 MP.L2-3.8.6

#### Description

**Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of CUI stored on digital media during transport unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.**

Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, or  devices (including other information systems).Maintain list of authorized users defining their identity and associated role and sync with system, application and data layers.	Account requests must be authorized before	access	is granted.  

## 8.6 MP.L2-3.8.7

#### Description

**Control the use of removable media on system components.**

Removable media are any sort of media stockpiling that you can eliminate from your PC or machine (e.g., CDs, DVDs, diskettes, and USB drives). Compose a particular strategy for removable media.

## 8.7 MP.L2-3.8.8

#### Description

**Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner.**

Requiring recognizable proprietors (e.g., people, organizations, or ventures) for convenient storage devices decreases the general gamble of utilizing such advances by permitting organizations to dole out liability and responsibility for tending to known vulnerabilities in the devices.

## 8.8 MP.L2-3.8.9

#### Description

**Protect the confidentiality of backup CUI at storage locations.**

Organizations can utilize cryptographic instruments or option actual controls to safeguard the classification of reinforcement data at assigned capacity areas. Supported data containing CUI might incorporate system-level information and user level information.
